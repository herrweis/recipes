## Method

Chop carrots, capsicum and onions

Submerge the chopped potatoes in water (this will get rid of the outer starch and make them super creamy)

Serve on rice — I abandoned the vegan part at this point and served it with chicken katsu and pickled cucumbers (https://www.justonecookbook.com/sunomono-with-cucumber-and-wakame/)
