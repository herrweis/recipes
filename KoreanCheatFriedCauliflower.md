- 1 tablespoon gochujang(Korean red chili pepper paste)

## Method
### Cheat your way to the deep fried crunch
The biggest issue with oven baking things that are meant to be deep fried is the sogginess and the missing crunch. Also it never gets nice and golden brown. Here is a way to fix this issue. Fry off your panko in a pan beforehand. Mix one or two tablespoons of oil in a pan with the panko (cold) and turn on the heat. Frequently stir until the panko turns nice and golden brown. Be careful that it doesn't burn. You really really have to stir frequently. Fill the panko into a bowl, tray or plate (whatever you want to use for coating).

Mix all ingredients for the batter in a bowl and coat the cauliflower evenly. Coat the battered cauliflower with the golden brown panko and lay on a baking tray.

Bake for about 30—40 mins in the oven at 200˚ (fan on) turning it once or twice.

### Meanwhile
Make the sticky sauce for coating. Add all the sauce ingredients to a pan and bring to a boil. Once it's boiling turn down the heat and let it bubble away until it gets thick and sticky.

### Finish
Once the cauliflower is done, toss it in the pan until it is coated nice and evenly with the sticky sauce. Sprinkle some fresh spring onion and toasted sesame seeds on top and tuck in while it's hot.
