#Hungarian Beef Goulash

## Ingredients

- Stew beef (e.g. Stew Steak, Bolar Blade)  
	~ 300g–350g per person
- Onions (cut up onions should be the same volume as the cut up beef)
- Garlic (a lot)
- Lemon (~1 lemon per kg meat, untreated because you need the zest)
- Capsicum (~2 per kg meat)
- Sweet Paprika powder (1 tbsp per kg meat, recommend to buy a good one)
- Hot paprika powder to make it spicy (to taste)
- Caraway seeds (1/2 tbsp per kg meat)
- Salt (to taste, but you will need more than you think)
- Pepper
- Red wine
- Butter
- Heat resistant oil (e.g. sunflower, vegetable, peanut)

## Method

Prep time: ~40–50 minutes (depending on your onion cutting speed)
Cooking time: ~3–4 hours

### Step 1 — Meat and onions
First cut up the meat in ~2cm cubes and put them in a bowl. Cut the onions into small cubes and put them into another bowl (same size) next to the meat until the volume of onions and meat is roughly equal. It'll be a lot of onions :-)

### Step 2 — Flavour mixture
To prevent the caraway seeds from flying around in your kitchen, knead them into a knob of butter before finely cutting them up. Grate the lemon zest on top of the butter caraway mixture and mash them in. Chop the garlic and add it to the flavour package

### Step 3 — Brown the shit out of that meat
Put the largest pot you have on the hottest heat source you have. Let it heat up until it is screaming hot, add a bit of the oil and put in the first pieces of meat. IMPORTANT: Do not, I repeat, DO NOT overfill the pot at this stage. Just put in a few cubes spaced apart about 1cm and brown them thoroughly. Transfer them into a bowl or onto a plate and repeat to brown the rest of the meat in batches. The brown-blackish stuff that forms on the bottom of your pot during the process is all the flavour goodness that makes the Goulash.

### Step 4 — Assemble the Goulash
Stove still on full whack, add the onions and soften them continuously stirring (we want them soft, not fried). If everything goes well, the onions should start releasing water, picking up all the brown stuff and the bottom of the pot should get back its natural clean colour. Once the onions are softened add the butter-caraway-garlic-lemon-flavour mixture and all the paprika powder and fry for a bit until the smell gets really nice in your kitchen. Squeeze in the juice of the lemons, add a good lug of red wine (~200ml per kg meat) and chuck all the meat back in (don't forget the meat juices that have gathered at the bottom of the bowl). Stir everything together, add salt and pepper and top up with a bit of water (I normally fill it up to about 1cm below the top of the meat).

### Step 5 — Most crucial part
Once the Goulash is boiling again, turn down the heat to lowest and let it simmer. Pour yourself a glass of the nice red wine and sit back and relax. Nothing else to do really for the next 2 hours. Well you should stir occasionally. Like every 30 minutes or so.

### Step 6 — Add the veggies
You are probably on your third glass of red wine, so be careful while cutting the capsicum in rough chunks. Add to the Goulash, stir and pour your fourth glass.

### Step 7 — Finish
About 1–2 hours later the Goulash should be thickened and the meat should be cuttable with a spoon. Season with salt and pepper to taste. You should still be able to cut some bread (or cook rice or pasta) if you haven't opened another bottle of wine in the meantime, so do that and then organise your sides and gather everyone to get their portion of Goulash. If you want to be fancy sprinkle some thinly cut red onions and some fresh cut parsley over the plate and finish off with a pickled chilli on top.
